        <p>Hello!</p>
        <p> My name is Anna Sippel and I am from Chicago, Illinois, but I now reside in beautiful Denver, Colorado.
            I graduated in 2016 from Washing University in St. Louis, where I majored in Business and Accounting, and was a captain on the Womens Varsity Socccer Team. I am now learning how to code in the University of Denver's Full-Stack Coding Bootcamp.</p>
        <p>The purpose of this portfolio is to demonstrate my ability to work with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript,
            MongoDB, React, and general programming platforms. I love to be creative and am constantly in pursuit of
            learning new skills!</p>
        <p>I enjoy playing soccer, exploring the great outdoors, being creative, and spending time with loved ones.</p>
        <p>Here is the link to my <a href = "https://github.com/asippel129">GitHub Repository</a> to take a look at what I have been working on during my time at University of Denver's Coding Bootcamp. </p>
        <p>Thank you for taking the time to read a little about me! Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions.</p>
